# Help

**Background**

The 1000 Challenge is a global initiative developed by **[Nursing Now Challenge](https://www.nursingnow.org/)** and **[The Global Health Network](https://tghn.org/)** to enable 1000 nurses, midwives, community health workers, and other allied health professionals in low-resource settings to lead research studies that gather evidence to address priority issues in their communities. This is a powerful opportunity for leadership and career development delivered through workplace learning whilst generating vital evidence to improve health outcomes in their communities, and by doing, creating leadership experience.

This challenge is needed because there is vast inequity in where research happens, who leads, and who benefits from the evidence. Too few studies address health issues where accessible and pragmatic solutions could change outcomes in patients. For many reasons healthcare settings to do not have research built into their operations and system and so their healthcare professionals are not supported, encouraged, or mandated to undertake research that could practically and effectively reduce the burden of a devasting health challenge â€“ and tackle gaps they see every day. Such research can generate evidence to inform changes in practice, training, or guidance, or healthcare resource allocation, program development, and implementation. The 1000 Challenge system is a mechanism to introduce research into these care settings by taking these workers through the process and guiding every step and element that is needed to deliver good quality evidence that can change practice.

**How it works**

The 1000 Challenge is an opportunity for nurses, midwives, community health workers, and other allied health professionals in low-resource settings to identify and be supported in setting up pragmatic and achievable studies designed to solve challenging healthcare issues they experience in their practice. These studies could be observational, social science (behavioural or practice), diagnostic, or clinical trials involving registered drugs or non-pharmaceutical interventions. These will ask locally important questions to generate evidence that can be taken up to change practice to improve patient management, care, prevention or treatment.

Help, support, training, tools, and resources will be provided to each research team for every step of the process. This will be delivered through this highly interactive online collaborative study builder facility. This begins by setting the question, progresses through running the study, right through to setting out how findings could be taken up into practice and sharing their recommendations. At each step the team are asked if they need any help and this is provided by connecting to specific digital training and resource, and also directly to volunteer experts from across the globe who will guide steps in how to take forward each step.
