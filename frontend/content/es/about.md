# Guía de inicio rápido

## Paso 1: Crear una cuenta
- Ir a **[globalhealthstudybuilder.org](/)**
- Select the language you want to work in from the sidebar dropdown menu (currently English is available with Spanish, Portuguese and French to come).
- Click on **Login** or **Get started**
- Create an account: Enter email address and you will be sent a link to your inbox (check your spam or junk folder if the email has not arrived within a few minutes). Open the link in the same web browser you are currently using the Study Builder in. If you use the same web browser and don’t clear your cache, it will remember you next time.
- Create a password for your account, go to **Profile > Security** and add a password in the **New password** field and add again in the **Repeat new password** field, then **Submit**. You can also select two-factor security here. Next time you need to login, check the **If you prefer, use your password & don’t email option** underneath the submit button and enter your email and password.
- In **Profile > Personal profile**, please enter your **Name**, **Description**, **Search terms**, **Country** and **Region**. Enter your password to confirm and click **Submit** once.

## Step 2: Complete Professional Profile
- Before you can create a team or begin a Study Pathway, you need to complete your profile using the Professional Profile pathway.
- Select **Study pathways** on the sidebar menu and select **1000 Challenge Professional Profile**
- Select **Start** and read the form carefully before completing each question. When complete, select **Save and close**.

## Step 3: Join existing Study Team, create new Study Team, or begin as individual researcher

### Join existing Study Team
- If you are wanting to join an existing Study Team, contact the Team Lead who created it to invite you using the email address you registered an account with. 
- When the Team Lead has sent you an invite, you will be able to view and accept the invite in **Profile > Invitations**. Select the **tick** to accept. 
- Navigate to **My studies** in the sidebar and use the search function or filter to find and select the team you are now a member of and ready to collaborate.

### Create new Study Team or new Study Pathway as an individual researcher
- If you are an individual researcher without a team or you are the nominated Team Lead for your Study Team and want to create a new Study Pathway, navigate to **Study pathways** on the sidebar and select **1000 Challenge Study Pathway**. Select **Start**.
- This will create a new Study Team under the **My studies** section in the sidebar. 
- Select **Edit** and change the **name** of your Study Team, add a **Description**, **Search terms**, **Country** and **Region**. Click **Save** once.
- To invite members to join your study, select **Study members** and enter their email address into the field and select **Invite**.
- To view the status of all those invited, navigate to the “Invitations” tab
- Remember to also contact members separately so they know they are aware they are now part of the pathway.
- Once the invite has been accepted, they will appear as a **Viewer**. To enable the person to actively contribute and make comments throughout the journey through the Study pathway, change them to **Team member** under the **Study members** tab.
- To begin the Study pathway and start capturing your study, Select **Complete your study** and then **Review**.
- Complete the questions step by step and remember to **Save** often; you don’t have to finish the whole pathway in one go. **Help and resources** are available for you at each step of the way.
