# Obalúayé

## What is it?

A framework for developing support pathways to guide researchers to design and complete a pragmatic and achievable study. The stack consists of a backend database and frontend progressive web application permitting easy pathway development, multilanguage support, and ensuring collaboration and discovery.

The development roadmap is intended to deliver the following components:

- Research pathways guide, including structured questionnaires with associated help resources,
- Response management for evaluating responses to research pathways,
- User moderation,
- Reports dashboard for review and including in project evaluations,
- News / blog / Knowledge-base support.

The first release must support multiple languages both statically (in the app) and dynamically (in the database).

## Background

The 1,000 Nurse-led Research Global Challenge is intended to reach nurses, midwives, and community health workers in low-resource settings, managing diseases of poverty to enable them to design and complete a pragmatic and achievable study within their care setting: from setting the research question, running the study, right through to taking the findings up into practice and sharing their recommendations. 

The program is a joint initiative of the [Nursing Now Challenge](https://www.nursingnow.org/) and [The Global Health Network](https://tghn.org/), leveraging their extensive global communities.
